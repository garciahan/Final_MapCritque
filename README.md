# Final Map Critque :walking: :car: :bike:
This is a report descriping The [***Portland Traffic Deaths and Injuries since 2007***](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=5385b143768c445db915a9c7fad32ebe) made on ArcGIS online and was created by the city of Portland. The goal of this report is to wirte up a map critique including a decription, data sources, style, and map elements.

### Description
The ***Portland Traffic Deaths and Injuries since 2007*** was created by The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) September, 2017. Within PBOT the Vision Zero is dedicated preventing future accidents. The map represents traffic accidents that occur on major corridors that lead to an injury or death. This map help visualize where accidents occur on arterial streets and categorizes accidents by category: car, bike or pedestrian. The map has a dark greyscale basmap while arterial streets are highlighted in yellow. Crashed are represented by orange and bright light grey circles. City officials and people interested in Vision Zero would find this map useful when identifying streets and intersections where accidents occur this leading to safer street design, lowering speed limts and promoting . 

### Map features
**Fetures & Elements**
* Dark netural basemap. This implies that the thematic layers are the focus of the map.
* Map title with author and sharable links (Facebook, Twitter and Share button).
* Side anel with map description and legands.
* Symbols representing diffrent features.
* City of Portland Boundary is darker than the basemap to area of focues is easily known.
* Graph in the side panel adds another way to visualize the data on the map.

**Thamatic and interactive layers**
* Thamatic layers on the map are the crash points and the street layers.
* Interactive features include clickinng on points and a info box pops up with data attributed to it. Data attributed to crash points are the date of crash, time, day, number of injuries or deaths, speed, incluence of drugs or alchohol during the crash and if a bike, car por pedestrian were involved. 
* Zoom in out, and recenter button on the map. Also a enter address box to find crashed near an address. 
* Another interactive feature is the tabs on the side panel. The tabs are "All deaths & injuries", "People in vehicals", "People walking" and " People biking" Clicking on those tabs will select crashed specific to the type of crash it is then the webmap on the side will also change to refelect the chosen tab.

Does the application keep consistent?

Are important information easy to find?

Are there opportunities for interaction?

Are there a lot of text-only pages?

Is the title descriptive and appealing?

Is there a brief introduction?

Does the application consider the load balance?

Is there any typo or prorgamming error?

Visual contrast

Legibility

Figure-ground organization

Hierarchical organization

Balance

describe the basemap, the thematic layer and the interactive features.

Does this web map support responsive design?
From your own perspective, what is the merits of this web map, and how this web map could be further improved?
