# Final Map Critique :walking: :car: :bike:
This is a report describing The [***Portland Traffic Deaths and Injuries since 2007***](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=5385b143768c445db915a9c7fad32ebe) made on ArcGIS online and was created by the city of Portland. The goal of this report is to write up a map critique including a description, data sources, style, and map elements. 

### Description
The [***Portland Traffic Deaths and Injuries since 2007***](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=5385b143768c445db915a9c7fad32ebe) was created by The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) September, 2017. Within PBOT the Vision Zero is dedicated preventing future accidents. The map represents traffic accidents that occur on major corridors that lead to an injury or death. This map help visualizes where accidents occur on arterial streets and categorizes accidents by category: car, bike or pedestrian. The map has a dark greyscale basemap while arterial streets are highlighted in yellow. Crashed are represented by orange and bright light grey circles. City officials and people interested in Vision Zero would find this map useful when identifying streets and intersections where accidents occur this leading to safer street design, lowering speed limits and promoting. 

### Map features
**Features & Elements**
* Dark neutral basemap. This implies that the thematic layers are the focus of the map.
* Map title with author and sharable links (Facebook, Twitter and Share button).
* Side panel with map description and legends.

* Symbols representing different features.
* City of Portland Boundary is darker than the basemap to area of focus is easily known.
* Graph in the side panel adds another way to visualize the data on the map.
* In the side panel the authors credit their data, has "last updated" information, and includes links to their Vision Zero team and how they process their crash data. 

**Thematic and interactive layers**
* Thematic layers on the map are the crash points and the street layers.
* Interactive features include clicking on points and an info box pops up with data attributed to it. Data attributed to crash points are the date of crash, time, day, number of injuries or deaths, speed, influence of drugs or alcohol during the crash and if a bike, car for pedestrian were involved.

* Zoom in out, and re-center button on the map. Also a enter address box to find crashed near an address. 
* Another interactive feature is the tabs on the side panel. The tabs are "All deaths & injuries", "People in vehicles", "People walking" and " People biking" Clicking on those tabs will select crashed specific to the type of crash it is then the web map on the side will also change to reflect the chosen tab.

### List of Data Source
Data for this map was collected by Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Portland Police Bureau. See the image below to see how PBOT collects their crash data. All data in the map are vector format, with crashes as points and streets are polylines.

### System Architecture
PBOT has a GIS database that stores all GIS data for the city to use. The city works mainly with ESI products and offers open source data [here](https://gis-pdx.opendata.arcgis.com/). The map was created on ArcGIS online, which is an easy webserver to work with to let users create and publish web maps online. 

### Map Design Critique

This map is consistent with colors, the basemap is a dark grayscale and the features of interest are yellow, light grey and orange. These colors provide great contrast with the dark basemap. All the information is easily available in the side panel. 
provides symbology description and a bar graph, which is a great way to display the data in another way. Side panel also includes what data is being showed and where the data came from. Anytime a URL is mentioned it is hyperlinked for users to click on. The side panel is a little text heavy but there is hierarchy so users know what to read first. 
There are many opportunities to interact with the map, in map portion of the map users are able to scroll across the map, and zoom in/out to look at specific areas. There is also an address bar so if users were interested in looking at crashes on their street they can type is in and the map will zoom to the location.
The title is informative and tells users that the, map is about traffic deaths and injuries from 2007 - present. The map has no formal introduction but all the other features in the side panel implies what the map is about.
The balance of the web map is great, features are separated and the entire page is being used so there is no uneasy empty space. Also the font is consistent only two different fonts are used in the map and there are less than 5 colors used (orange, yellow, black, white and gray). Itâ€™s easy to tell that features in yellow, orange and gray are the most important elements since they pop off the page. 
The symbology is legible, the author chose circles to represent crashed that lead to deaths and injuries. The different sizes of the circles represent magnitude of number of crashes. The figure ground organization is good; the city of Portland boundary is darker than the rest of the basemap so users can tell what the city boundaries are. 

### Final Discussions
Overall this map has a great design and creates a geospatial visualization of crashes in Portland. The only suggestion is to fix the zoom level when entering in address the map. When entering in a address the zoom goes in super close, so users have to zoom back out to see roads and data.
